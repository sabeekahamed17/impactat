                    <p>For years I have been studying and discussing issues involved in raising children and preparing them for the challenges Life poses for them...I noticed that many parents look toward "experts" for techniques, path and answers to the questions that come up when working with children. After spending years as a parent myself I can offer various insights I have had which are grounded in my personal experiences with my own daughter.</p>
                    <p>What I have "seen" is being open and respectful works towards gaining the respect which we so Yearn for from our children. Working with various other children in my sessions also showed me that every child is a unique person and that almost all of them are born equal. It's the space in which they grow up that seems to give a direction to what path our Children choose to tread.</p>
                    <p>As a parent myself and watching other parents I also noticed that we have a tendency to jump in to "rescue" our children based on our perception of a tight spot. What if we could resist that temptation specifically? What if we knew that it will all turn out for the best in the end anyway? Wonderful!!</p>

                    <h4>ON RELATIONSHIPS</h4>
                    <p>Through this program you will find more satisfaction and depth in your relationships, your personal and working life. You'll find more enthusiasm, motivation, and enjoyment overall and spend more time in that frame of mind in which you do your best thinking. I work with couples, parents, individuals and business leaders. KAY's services are progressive and substantial, and create noticeable and immediate results, that last.</p>
                    <h4>INDIVIDUALS</h4>
                    <p>There has been a revolutionary set of discoveries in the field of psychology that gives people a clear understanding of how change actually happens. When people change on the inside, it changes how they go about their lives and their relationships. We teach people these discoveries. As a result, our clients get out from under their unproductive, circular, and exhaustive thinking.</p>
                    <h4>COUPLES INTENSIVE</h4>
                    <p>This program gives you an opportunity to disengage from the daily workings of life, step back, and look at a bigger picture. You will spend 4 days one-on-one with me. This is a popular program. It is a learning and development retreat to give you a solid grasp of the principles we teach that have the potential to change everything about your life. During the four days you will have one-on-one meetings with me twice each day. There will be breaks in between sessions for reflection and review of supporting materials. The meetings consist of discussion and directive learning that is specifically oriented to your life and current situation. Phone follow-up is included in the program and helps keep the learning alive after you return home.</p>
