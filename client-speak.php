"I wasn't quite sure of what a transformation coach would do for me but I soon realised that she was transforming the way I not only did things but how I thought of myself. I now give myself the credit to my successes where as before her I tended to see all the things I hadn't achieved. She helped me to identify the issues that I could control, the issues I can influence and issues that are out of my hand. She gave very little direct instructions and instead did a lot of listening and asking guiding questions which made me think .This led me to self realisation ultimately. Her positive energy has helped me to make choices from a place of optimism instead of fear and anxiety which has had  a powerful impact on my life so far. I really had no idea what I was aiming for, except finding a new path for myself and she helped me to steer myself towards a new  future. After working with her I was able to clearly articulate a future vision for myself and to define my priorities. I am taking care of myself. I am a better person today. When I meet people I haven't  seen for a while they comment on how happy ,energized and positive I look .I tell them it's due to Kamini mam. Thank you mam for helping me find my way back to a balanced life and happiness ".</p>

			<p class="testimonial">The experience was profound, insightful and invigorating.One gets to turn inward and make a journey within their self gently with absolute openness. The analogies that she quoted and the open questions she asked created a dimension within oneself to look beyond their accumulated body and mind. It touches the very spirit and bringing absolute clarity within oneself at the end of the conversation. I could sense the SILENCE within me even when the environment was chaotic...that's the success of THE COACH. </p>

			<p class="testimonial">Do we realise we have our own two legs to stand upon and we don't need those crutches? Growing up very independent, ambitious, with a lot of plans - long n short..and all came to a "pause" when marriage happened..turned out it wasnt a "pause".what an irony ! It isn't just about your experiences. I saw not two sets of prints, a lot of times, it was just one set of foot prints, You and then I, on the same path ! Thank u for relating your experiences ! I am happy to have found a friend n coach in you!</p>
