"I wasn't quite sure of what a transformation coach would do for me but I soon realised that she was transforming the way I not only did things but how I thought of myself. I now give myself the credit to my successes where as before her I tended to see all the things I hadn't achieved. She helped me to identify the issues that I could control,the issues I can influence and issues that are out of my hand.She gave very little direct instructions and instead did a lot of listening and asking guiding questions which made me think .This led me to self realisation ultimately. Her positive energy has helped me to make choices from a place of optimism instead of fear and anxiety which has had  a powerful impact on my life so far.I really had no idea what I was aiming for,except finding a new path for myself and she helped me to steer myself towards a new  future. After working with her I was able to clearly articulate a future vision for myself and to define my priorities. I am taking care of myself. I am a better person today.When I meet people I haven't  seen for a while they comment on how happy ,energized and positive I look .I tell them it's due to Kamini mam. Thank you mam for helping me find my way back to a balanced life and happiness ".  Dr.Geetha Dental surgeon Chennai.

<p><b>I call myself as a Transformative Life Coach now.</b><br>
  To be successful in any field of your choosing my experience tells me that you have to be Impactful and for that you should have been Impacted. 

   For nearly 10 years (in the field) and otherwise my whole life I have been examining the source of Impact when working with people.

Transformative Coaching or Super Coaching

In Super Coaching we are not looking at getting more out ourselves with our  performance in a particular area of of life….

</p>
<p><b>We are taking a deeper look at who we are, and how we work….What Life is and how Life works?
</b><br>It's like a whole new way of being in the world emerges and you get to know yourself a little bit better.

Imagine yourself as you being unleashed….The freedom to choose, and to do and be whatever that is you wanted to….Unleashing you from all the ideas you have got about life, about the past and what's possible or not possible for you.


You get to experience unbridled joy of Life..In Fact there are three things that happen in a Transformative Coaching or Supercoaching scenario…

The first is you come alive. You wake up to yourself at a deeper level… 

Then we also learn to Navigate life beyond your psychology. Psychology is about learn how you are broken and then fix it.


And then what else? You get to create cool stuff in the world. Most people hire a coach so they get to create the cool stuff.
