FRESH IDEAS. UNPARALLELED PERFORMANCE. FULFILLED LIFE. I’m a Transformative Life Coach who helps Leaders, Entrepreneurs and Solopreneurs have fresh ideas, create incredible impact, and profit from stronger performance. By helping my clients access the untapped potential of their minds, they find new levels of success with less stress, while fostering a rich and fulfilling work and home life.
When you run a company and lead others, having someone who is direct, tells you the truth and challenges you to expand your thinking has proven to be a rare and powerful resource.</p>

 You will be a better leader and make smarter decisions with your Coach by your side.

A few years ago when working with a few clients I realised that there are certain things that are undiscovered within each of us that either empowers or disempowers us. When people understand the nature of that untapped potential it changes everything. It gives us the ability to thrive, influence, make smart decisions, build a business, connect with clients, family and friends more powerfully… and do it all with more ease and grace. This hidden variable, based on a set of principles I teach, has been the single most influential factor in my own performance.

       <p><b>MENTORING</b><br>
Does having someone in your corner sound good to you? Would you like to have a partner that supports your development, your impact and orients you in the direction of new potential and real-world results?

My work and my life have been touched deeply by mentors and teachers. Working with others in this way, has proven to create powerful shifts.
</p>
<p><b>1:1 MENTORING</b><BR>

Are you a business owner, coach, or person that would benefit from in-depth mentorship and partnership over an extended period of time? Working one-on-one in this capacity is a game changer.

</p>
<p><b>INDIVIDUALS</b><br>
  There has been a revolutionary set of discoveries in the field of psychology that gives people a clear understanding of how change actually happens. When people change on the inside, it changes how they go about their lives and their relationships. We teach people these discoveries. As a result, our clients get out from under their unproductive, circular, and exhaustive thinking.
</p>
<p><b>COUPLES INTENSIVE</b><br>
  This program gives you an opportunity to disengage from the daily workings of life, step back, and look at a bigger picture. You will spend 4 days one-on-one with me. This is a popular program. It is a learning and development retreat to give you a solid grasp of the principles we teach that have the potential to change everything about your life.
During the four days you will have one-on-one meetings with me twice each day. There will be breaks in between sessions for reflection and review of supporting materials. The meetings consist of discussion and directive learning that is specifically oriented to your life and current situation.
Phone follow-up is included in the program and helps keep the learning alive after you return home.
