<div class="col-md-12"> <p>For years I have been studying and discussing issues involved in raising children and preparing them for the challenges Life poses for them...I noticed that many parents look toward "experts" for techniques, path and answers to the questions that come up when working with children.
After spending years as a parent myself I can offer various insights I have had which are grounded in my personal experiences with my own daughter.
What I have "seen" is being open and respectful works towards gaining the respect which we so year from our children. 
Working with various other children in my sessions also showed me that every child is a unique person and that almost all of them are born equal. It's the space in which they grow up that seems to give a direction to what the children turn out to be.
As a parent myself and watching other parents I also noticed that we have a tendency to jump in to "rescue" our children based on our perception of a tight spot.
What if we could resist that temptation specifically? What if we knew that it will all turn out for the best in the end anyway? Wonderful!!</p>

The brain has this ability to, at almost any age, completely re-pattern itself with the right suggestions and behaviours. But often after a certain age, it will only take a severe disruption of the default mode network for people to look at the world differently, and when you look at things differently, the brain starts to behave differently.

It's all a matter of how much responsibility we take for our own minds, our own thinking, our thought processes, and the environments we create internally and in our own worlds too.

The beautiful thing about today is that there’s always tomorrow. With the gift of tomorrow, we can always change.
