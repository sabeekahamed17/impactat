       <p><b>MENTORING</b><br>
Does having someone in your corner sound good to you? Would you like to have a partner that supports your development, your impact and orients you in the direction of new potential and real-world results?

My work and my life have been touched deeply by mentors and teachers. Working with others in this way, has proven to create powerful shifts.
</p>
<p><b>1:1 MENTORING</b><BR>

Are you a business owner, coach, or person that would benefit from in-depth mentorship and partnership over an extended period of time? Working one-on-one in this capacity is a game changer.

These engagements last 6-9 months and include a 3-4-day intensive, on-going coaching, review of business plan, collaboration, and creative partnership.

<p>Because of the nature of the mentor/mentee relationship, I only take 2-3 at a time. This allows plenty of space, time and availability to create a powerful, rich, in-depth and holistic program that creates sustained transformation and real-world results.</p></div>

<p><b>INDIVIDUALS</b><br>
  There has been a revolutionary set of discoveries in the field of psychology that gives people a clear understanding of how change actually happens. When people change on the inside, it changes how they go about their lives and their relationships. We teach people these discoveries. As a result, our clients get out from under their unproductive, circular, and exhaustive thinking.
</p>
<p><b>COUPLES INTENSIVE</b><br>
  This program gives you an opportunity to disengage from the daily workings of life, step back, and look at a bigger picture. You will spend 4 days one-on-one with me. This is a popular program. It is a learning and development retreat to give you a solid grasp of the principles we teach that have the potential to change everything about your life.
During the four days you will have one-on-one meetings with me twice each day. There will be breaks in between sessions for reflection and review of supporting materials. The meetings consist of discussion and directive learning that is specifically oriented to your life and current situation.
Phone follow-up is included in the program and helps keep the learning alive after you return home.
