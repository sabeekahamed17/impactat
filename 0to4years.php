                    <p>For years I have been studying and discussing issues involved in raising children and
                        preparing them for the challenges Life poses for them...I noticed that many parents look
                        toward "experts" for techniques, path and answers to the questions that come up when working
                        with children. After spending years as a parent myself I can offer various insights I have
                        had which are grounded in my personal experiences with my own daughter.</p>
                    <p> What I have "seen" is being open and respectful works towards gaining the respect which we
                        so Yearn for from our children. Working with various other children in my sessions also
                        showed me that every child is a unique person and that almost all of them are born equal.
                        It's the space in which they grow up that seems to give a direction to what path our
                        Children choose to tread. </p>
                    <p> As a parent myself and watching other parents I also noticed that we have a tendency to jump
                        in to "rescue" our children based on our perception of a tight spot. What if we could resist
                        that temptation specifically? What if we knew that it will all turn out for the best in the
                        end anyway? Wonderful!!

                    The brain has this ability to, at almost any age, completely re-wire itself with the right
                    suggestions and behaviours. But often after a certain age, it will only take a severe disruption
                    of the default mode network for people to look at the world differently, and when you look at
                    things differently, the brain starts to behave differently.</p>
                <p>

                    It's all a matter of how much responsibility we take for our own minds, our own thinking, our
                    thought processes, and the environments we create internally and in our own worlds too. The
                    beautiful thing about today is that thereâ€™s always tomorrow.<b>"With the gift of tomorrow, we
                        can always change"</b>.</p>
